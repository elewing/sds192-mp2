## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!
This is my change

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}
make_state_graphic <- function(state_name) {
  contribution_totals <- contributions %>%
    filter(state == state_name) %>%
    group_by(cand_id) %>%
    summarize(total_cont = sum(transaction_amt))
  
  state_cands <- house_elections %>%
    filter(state == state_name) %>%
    filter(!is.na(ge_winner)) %>%
    left_join(contribution_totals, by = c("fec_id" = "cand_id")) %>%
    select(candidate_name, 
           incumbent, 
           party, 
           ge_winner, 
           total_cont) %>%
    mutate(total_cont = ifelse(is.na(total_cont),0,total_cont))
}

make_state_graphic("OH")
```
